article0_title = Static HTML
article0_title_post = 
article0_paragraph0 = The advantage of a static HTML website is quite obvious: Compatibility. On almost every device capable to browse the internet, this website can be displayed and used in the exact same manner, even while being offline, all the information stays available.
article0_paragraph1 = No scripting, no asynchronous reloading, no cookies, no external assets and no special effects.

article1_title = Translations
article1_title_post = 
article1_paragraph0 = Now you could save a static HTML file for every language you are offering. However, since many web servers already support PHP, it is adviced to simply use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">i18n</a>-file.
article1_paragraph1 = Having one or more of these file (see <i>/languages</i> directory), the contents will be readable in multiple translated languages. The file <i>/templates/sites.html</i> represents the actual template including all placeholders.



post0_title = CSS instead of JavaScript
post0_title_post = 
post0_paragraph0 = Having a user change the contents is usually achieved by a classic hyperlink or by using a script. A less common technique is using CSS. By having suitable styles, you can hide <i>passive</i> content and display the <i>active</i> one. The content to be displayed is "activated" as soon as the anchor in the current URL corresponds to the <i>id</i> attribute of the layer element.
post0_paragraph1 = However, there is one constraint in the <a href="http://newtork.github.io/">current version</a> of this template: All content pages, which are not "active" at the beginning, must have at least the same vertical length as the landing page. Otherwise, an activated content page will not completely "overlap" the underlying start page.

post1_title = User inputs
post1_title_post = 
post1_paragraph0 = An important feature of this template is the possibility of storing user inputs. For this purpose, there are simple selection fields (<i>radioboxes</i>) as well as input fields for single line and multiple lines.
post1_paragraph1 = After the form has submitted, the data is sent to <i>/index.php</i>, where the script verifies an extra security token and then stores the information to a <i>log.request.txt</i> text file.
